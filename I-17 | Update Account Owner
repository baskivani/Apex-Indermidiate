User Story:
As a system administrator for our Salesforce organization,

I want to automate the process of changing the owner of all newly created (today) Accounts to a specific User named John Smith.
public static void changeuser(){
        List<Account> myList = [SELECT Id, OwnerId From Account WHERE CreatedDate= TODAY];
        User u= [SELECT Id FROM USER WHERE FirstName= 'John' AND LastName='Smith' LIMIT 1];
        for(Account ac: myList){
            ac.OwnerId= u.Id;
        }
        update myList;
}
