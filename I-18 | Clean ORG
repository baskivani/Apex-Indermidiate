As a Salesforce administrator, I want to create a method to clear all the data in my Salesforce org, so that I can prepare the org for testing or data migration purposes.

Acceptance Criteria:

The method should be named clearORG.
The method should delete all the Entitlement, Case, Opportunity, Contact, and Account records in the org.
The method should be a public static void method, which means it should not return anything.

public static void clearORG(){
        
        List<Entitlement> enList =[SELECT id FROM Entitlement];
        
        delete enList;
        
        List<Case> cList = [SELECT id FROM Case];
        delete cList;
        
        List<Opportunity> oppList = [SELECT id FROM Opportunity];
        delete oppList;
        
        List<Contact> conList = [SELECT id FROM Contact];
        delete conList;
        
        List<Account> acList = [SELECT id FROM Account];
        delete acList;
    }
