As a sales representative, I want to quickly create a new account for a prospective customer so that I can begin tracking their information and progress.

I can use the AccountUtility class to create a single account. This class contains a method called "CreateSingleAccount()" that creates a new Account record with the name "Blue Moon Hotel".

When I call this method, it will insert the new account record into Salesforce and return the newly created Account object. I can then use this object to add additional information to the account as needed. 

public class AccountUtility {
    
    public static Account CreateSingleAccount(){
        
        Account ac = new Account();
        ac.Name='Blue Moon Hotel';
        insert ac;
        
        return ac;
    }

}
