As a Salesforce user, I want to create a new Account record with a specific name if an Account record with the same name does not already exist in the org.

Account ac = new Account();

String acName ='Blue Moon Hotel';
List<Account> acList = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE name =: acName];

if(acList.size()==0){
    ac.Name=acName;
}
insert ac;
