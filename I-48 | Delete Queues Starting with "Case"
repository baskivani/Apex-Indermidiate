As a Salesforce Administrator, I need to be able to delete Queues starting with "Case" in Apex. These Queues are no longer needed and are cluttering up my Salesforce org. I want a way to delete them all at once to save time and ensure that my org remains organized.



List<Group> queuesToDelete = [SELECT Id FROM Group WHERE Name LIKE 'Case%'];

if (queuesToDelete.size() > 0) {
    Database.DeleteResult[] deleteResults = Database.delete(queuesToDelete, false);
    
    for (Database.DeleteResult result : deleteResults) {
        if (result.isSuccess()) {
            System.debug('Queue deleted successfully: ' + result.getId());
        } else {
            System.debug('Failed to delete queue: ' + result.getErrors()[0].getMessage());
        }
    }
} else {
    System.debug('No queues found to delete.');
}
