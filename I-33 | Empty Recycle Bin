As a Salesforce administrator, I want to permanently delete all the records that have been deleted by the users in the org and are currently residing in the Recycle Bin so that I can free up storage space and maintain data integrity.

List<Account> acList =[SELECT Id, isdeleted FROM Account WHERE isdeleted =true ALL ROWS];
List<Contact> conList =[SELECT Id, isdeleted FROM Contact  WHERE isdeleted =true ALL ROWS];
List<Case> caseList =[SELECT Id, isdeleted FROM Case  WHERE isdeleted =true ALL ROWS];
List<Opportunity> oppList =[SELECT Id, isdeleted FROM Opportunity  WHERE isdeleted =true ALL ROWS];

List<SObject> RecBinList = new List<SObject>();
RecBinList.addALL(acList);
RecBinList.addALL(conList);
RecBinList.addALL(caseList);
RecBinList.addALL(oppList);

Database.emptyRecycleBin(RecBinList);
