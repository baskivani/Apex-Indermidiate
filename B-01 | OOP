Object-oriented programming in Apex is a programming paradigm that is supported by programming languages. This approach is based on creating objects and their interactions to solve programming problems.

Apex is designed as an object-oriented programming language and therefore uses OOP concepts. In Apex, an object class is a template with properties (variables) and behaviors (methods). These classes allow application developers to create customizable and reusable code snippets.

Object-oriented programming helps make code in Apex more understandable, easier to maintain, and expandable. It also provides a standard for collaboration and code sharing among application developers.

Here's an example class in Apex with some methods:

public class BasicMath {
    
    // Dikdörtgenin alanını hesaplayan method
    public static double area(double length, double width) {
        return length * width;
    }

    // Dikdörtgenin çevresini hesaplayan method
    public static double perimeter(double length, double width) {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }
}
