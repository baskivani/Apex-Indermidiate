As a mentor, I want you to demonstrate and compare different approaches for creating an Account in Salesforce. This will help provide a comprehensive understanding of the available options and their implications.

First Approach:

insert new Account(Name='Bank of America');
Second Approach:

Account ac = new Account(Name='Bank of America');
insert ac;
Third Approach:

Account ac = new Account();
ac.Name='Bank of America';
insert ac;
