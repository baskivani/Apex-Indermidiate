As a system administrator, I want to be able to delete all public groups in the org, so that I can ensure that the organization's data is secure and follows the correct access control policies.
List<Group> publicGroups = [SELECT Id FROM Group WHERE Type = 'Regular' AND RelatedId = null];

if(!publicGroups.isEmpty()) {
    delete publicGroups;
    System.debug('All public groups have been deleted.');
} else {
    System.debug('No public groups found to delete.');
}
