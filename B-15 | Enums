An enum is an abstract data type with values that each take on exactly one of a finite set of identifiers that you specify. Enums are typically used to define a set of possible values that donâ€™t otherwise have a numerical order. Typical examples include the suit of a card, or a particular season of the year.

To define an enum, use the enum keyword in your declaration and use curly braces to demarcate the list of possible values.

For example, the following code creates an enum called Level:

public enum Level{LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH}
The enum type itself has no constructor syntax.
public class EnumClass {
    
    public enum Season {WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL}
    
    public static void show(){
        
        System.debug(season.winter);
    }

}
