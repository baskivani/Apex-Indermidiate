Upsert: 

In Apex, upsert is a DML operation that allows you to insert new records or update existing records in a single call. The term "upsert" is a combination of "update" and "insert".

When you perform an upsert operation, Salesforce first tries to find a record with a matching external ID. If a record is found, it is updated with the new data. If no matching record is found, a new record is created with the specified data.

Contact con1 = new Contact();   
con1.FirstName='Josh';
con1.LastName='Kaplan';
con1.Department='Finance';
insert con1;
con1.Description = 'This contact is update after inserted.';

Contact con2 = new Contact();
con2.FirstName='Kathy';
con2.LastName='Brown';
con2.Department='Technology';
List<Contact> conList = new List<Contact> {con1, con2};
upsert conList;
