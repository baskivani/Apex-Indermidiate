As a Salesforce administrator, I want to be able to reactivate all the inactive user accounts in bulk so that I can save time and improve the efficiency of my tasks.

List<User> inactiveUsers = [SELECT Id, IsActive FROM User WHERE IsActive = false];

for(User u : inactiveUsers){
    u.IsActive = true;
}

update inactiveUsers;
