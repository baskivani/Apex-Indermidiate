User Story

As a user of the Salesforce platform, I want to ensure that the Other Address fields of my contacts are always in sync with their Mailing Address fields so that I can have accurate and up-to-date information about their location.

public class StringUtility {
    public void assignment() {
        List<Contact> conList = [SELECT Id, MailingStreet, MailingCity, MailingState, MailingPostalCode, OtherStreet, OtherCity, OtherState, OtherPostalCode, OtherCountry FROM Contact WHERE Mailing_Address_Is_Same_As_Other_Address__c=true];
        for (Contact i : conList) {
            i.OtherCity = i.MailingCity;
            i.OtherCountry = i.MailingCountry;
            i.OtherState = i.MailingState;
            i.OtherStreet = i.MailingStreet;
            i.OtherPostalCode = i.MailingPostalCode;
        }
        update conList;
    }
}
