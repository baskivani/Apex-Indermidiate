As a sales representative, I want to create a new lead record with all required details such as First Name, Last Name, and Company. If the lead status is "Closed - Converted", then I want to convert the lead into an account and a contact record, without creating a new opportunity. I want to make sure that the lead is converted with the correct converted status and that I can obtain the IDs of the newly created account and contact records.

Lead newLead = new Lead();
newLead.FirstName = 'John';
newLead.LastName = 'Doe';
newLead.Company = 'ABC Company';
newLead.Status = 'Closed - Converted';
insert newLead;

if(newLead.Status == 'Closed - Converted'){
    Database.LeadConvert lc = new database.LeadConvert();
    lc.setLeadId(newLead.Id);
    lc.setDoNotCreateOpportunity(true);
    
    LeadStatus convertStatus = [SELECT Id, MasterLabel FROM LeadStatus WHERE IsConverted=true LIMIT 1];
    
    lc.setConvertedStatus(convertStatus.MasterLabel);

    Database.LeadConvertResult lcr = Database.convertLead(lc);


    Id newAccountId = lcr.getAccountId();
    Id newContactId = lcr.getContactId();

}
