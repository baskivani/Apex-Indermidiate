As a Salesforce administrator, I want to update the role of a user with an existing role so that their access and permissions align with their current responsibilities and tasks within the organization.

UserRole selectedRole = [SELECT Id, Name, DeveloperName, ParentRoleId FROM UserRole WHERE Name ='Channel Sales Team' LIMIT 1];

User u = [SELECT Name, UserRoleId FROM User WHERE Name ='Engin Basturk' LIMIT 1];

u.UserRoleId = selectedRole.Id;

update u;
