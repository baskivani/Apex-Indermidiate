As a Salesforce administrator, I want to delete a list of records from various standard objects to ensure data cleanliness and optimize system performance.

Note: Put all the records in a list.

 
List<sObject> recordList = new List<sObject>();

List<Entitlement> enList = [SELECT Id FROM Entitlement];

recordList.addAll(enList);

List<Case> caseList = [SELECT Id FROM Case];

recordList.addAll(caseList);

List<Contact> conList = [SELECT Id FROM Contact];

recordList.addAll(conList);

List<Opportunity> OppList = [SELECT Id FROM Opportunity];

recordList.addAll(OppList);

List<Account> acList = [SELECT Id FROM Account];

recordList.addAll(acList);

List<Lead> leadList = [SELECT Id FROM Lead];

recordList.addAll(leadList);


delete recordList;
