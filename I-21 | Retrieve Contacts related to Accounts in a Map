As a Salesforce developer, I need to retrieve a list of contacts related to a set of accounts identified by their Ids.

    public static void retrieveContactsRelatedAccountsWithMap(){
        
        Map<Id, Account> mapAc = new Map<Id,Account>([Select Id From Account]);
        
        List<Contact> conList = [Select Id, Name From Contact Where AccountId In :mapAc.keySet()];
        
    }
