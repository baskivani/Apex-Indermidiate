Before triggers are used to update or validate record values before theyâ€™re saved to the database.
After triggers are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.

Examples:

trigger myAccountTrigger on Account(before insert) {
    for(Account acc: Trigger.New){
        acc.Description ='Test Description';
    }

}
new:
Returns a list of the new versions of the sObject records.
This sObject list is only available in insert, update, and undelete triggers, and the records can only be modified in before triggers.

Trigger.new is a list

Trigger.new[0] or Trigger.new.get(0) is the first record of the Trigger.new list.

trigger myAccountTrigger on Account(before insert)
{
   System.debug(Trigger.New[0].Name + ' is created. ');                              
}
Trigger.new is ussually used in for each loop:

trigger myAccountTrigger on Account(before insert)
{
    for(Account ac : Trigger.new) {
        System.debug(ac+' has been created. ');
    }                             
}
Account ac = new Account(Name='Blue Hotel');
insert ac;

old:
Returns a list of the old versions of the sObject records.
This sObject list is only available in update and delete triggers.

trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before update) {    
    
    System.debug(Trigger.Old[0].Name + ' is updated to: ' + Trigger.New[0].Name);
    
}
Account ac = [SELECT Id, Name from Account WHERE Name ='Blue Hotel' LIMIT 1];
ac.Name='New Blue Hotel';

update ac;
