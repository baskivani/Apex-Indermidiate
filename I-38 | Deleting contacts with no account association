As a system administrator, I want to delete all Contacts that are not associated with any Account so that the data in the system remains clean and accurate. This will be accomplished by executing a method that retrieves all Contacts with no associated Account, and then deletes them from the system. If there are no such Contacts, no action will be taken.
public static void deletecontacts(){
        List<Contact> conList= [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE AccountId=null];
        if(conList.size()!=0){
            delete conList;
        }
}
