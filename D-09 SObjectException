Any problem with SOQL queries, such as assigning a query that returns no records or more than one record to a singleton sObject variable.

Causes an SObjectException because we didn't retrieve the Description field.

try {
    Account ac= [SELECT Name FROM Account LIMIT 1];
    String s = ac.Description ;
} catch(SObjectException se) {
    System.debug('The following exception has occurred: ' + se.getMessage());
}
