An object is an instance of a class.

In Apex, You will need to create objects for non-static methods.

Here is the syntax of an object:

Class_Name Object_Name = new Class_Name ();
You can call the method with the object name:

Object_Name .Method_Name();
Example:

public class Calculator {    
    public Decimal surfaceArea(Decimal a, Decimal b, Decimal c){        
        Decimal sArea = 2*(a*b+b*c+a*c);        
        return sArea;        
    }
}
