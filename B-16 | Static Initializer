If you donâ€™t want to write your own constructor for a class, you can use an instance initialization code block to initialize instance variables. In simple situations, use an ordinary initializer. Reserve initialization code for complex situations, such as initializing a static map. A static initialization block runs only one time, regardless of how many times you access the class that contains it.

Static initialization code is a block of code preceded with the keyword static.

public class ApexClass {

   public static final Integer x; 

    static {
       x = 12;
   }
    
    public static void methodA(){
        
        System.debug(x);
    }
}
