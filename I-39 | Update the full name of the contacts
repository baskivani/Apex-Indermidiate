As a sales representative at XYZ company, I need to view a list of all contacts in the system and have their full name displayed in a separate field for easier identification.

To achieve this, the ContactUtility class has been created with a viewContacts() method. This method queries the Contact object to retrieve the first name, last name, and a custom field called full_name__c. It then loops through the list of contacts and concatenates the first and last names to populate the full_name__c field. Finally, it updates the contact records to reflect this change.

public class ContactUtility {
    public static void viewContacts(){
        List<Contact> conList = [SELECT FirstName, LastName, full_name__c  FROM Contact];
        for (Contact con : conList){
            con.full_name__c = con.FirstName +' ' + con.LastName;
        }
        update conList;
    }
}
