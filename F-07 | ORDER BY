You can specify the order in which search results are returned from a SOSL query using the ORDER BY clause. You can also use the clause to display empty records at the beginning or end of the results.

Use one or more ORDER BY clauses in a SOSL statement.

FIND {MyContactName} RETURNING Contact(Name, Id ORDER BY Name), Account(Description, Id ORDER BY Description)
This search returns account records in descending alphabetical order by name, with accounts that have null names appearing last.
