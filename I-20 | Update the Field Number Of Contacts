Create a program that updates the field Number_of_Contacts__c 

The field Number of Contacts must show the number of the Contacts each Account has

Hint: Create a field (Number_of_Contacts__c ) with Number data type

public static void UpdateNumberofContacts(){
        
        List<Account> acList = [SELECT Id, (SELECT Id FROM Contacts), Number_of_Contacts__c FROM Account WHERE Id  IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contact)];
        
        
        for(Account ac : acList){
            
            ac.Number_of_Contacts__c=ac.Contacts.size();
        }
        
        update acList;
        
        
    }
