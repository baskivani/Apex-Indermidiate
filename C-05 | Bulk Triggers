Single:
The following trigger assumes that only one record caused the trigger to fire. This trigger doesnâ€™t work on a full record set when multiple records are inserted in the same transaction.

trigger MyTriggerNotBulk on Account(before insert) {
    Account a = Trigger.New[0];
    a.Description = 'New description';
}
Bulk:
This example is a modified version of MyTrigger. It uses a for loop to iterate over all available sObjects. This loop works if Trigger.New contains one sObject or many sObjects.

trigger MyTriggerBulk on Account(before insert) {
    for(Account a : Trigger.New) {
        a.Description = 'New description';
    }
}
