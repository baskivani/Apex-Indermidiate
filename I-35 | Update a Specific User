As a Salesforce administrator, I want to update the first name and last name of a specific user in the org so that their profile information is accurate and up to date.

public static void updateUser(){
        User u= [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE UserName='practice@verizon.org' LIMIT 1];
        u.FirstName= 'Haley';
        u.LastName= 'Berry';
        update u;
}
