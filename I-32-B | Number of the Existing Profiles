As a Salesforce administrator, I want to retrieve the total number of profiles available in the org so that I can monitor and manage the profiles effectively.

public static Integer numberofprofiles(){
        List<Profile> myProfiles= [SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile];
        return myProfiles.size();
    }
}
