As an admin,

I want to be able to update the account numbers for multiple customer accounts,

So that I can easily assign a common account number to a group of accounts.

public class AccountUtility{
   public static void setAccountNumber(Account[] acList) {
      for (Account ac : acList){
         ac.AccountNumber = '1234567';
      }
        update acList;
   }
}
