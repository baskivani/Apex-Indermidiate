Be aware of the following considerations for trigger context variables:

trigger.new and trigger.old cannot be used in Apex DML operations.
You can use an object to change its own field values using trigger.new, but only in before triggers. In all after triggers, trigger.new is not saved, so a runtime exception is thrown.
trigger.old is always read-only.
You cannot delete trigger.new.
